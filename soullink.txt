It’s a Pokemon Nuzlocke! The rules are if a Pokemon faints, it’s dead forever and you can’t use it. :( You HAVE to nickname all encounters to get emotionally attached and you can only catch the first Pokemon in each new route and if you white out the game is over! Now the added rules of a soul link... 
A soul link is a 2 player Nuzlocke where once both players catch a Pokemon, they’re linked meaning if one of the pokemon dies the other dies as well - the nicknames are depending on the players some choose to nickname them the same thing as one another or a combo of the pokemons names to know they’re linked. 
Now for the rules of having a pair of linked pokemon... you can’t have the same primary typing pokemon on the same team or linked together so say Hayden catches a charmander which is primary fire aes can’t use any primary fire types until they take charmander off the team or he dies but she can have a secondary typing of fire like a centiskorch which is bug/fire. In the event that they get encounters that have the same primary typings one of them would have to rencounter. There’s also sometimes a gender rule people do when they catch pokemon like if Hayden’s encounter was a male aes would go until she found a female but that’s just a self imposed thing. If they don’t have any spare pairs in the pc in the event of a white out they lose!
