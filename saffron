Saffron is a vibrant presence, delicate yet deeply rooted in her surroundings, known for adding a subtle warmth and complexity wherever she goes. Her essence is rich and unmistakable—something that lingers in memory, whether encountered briefly or steeped in for a while. Joby edited this on 6/4/25 to say the following: "fart lol". There's a sweetness to her, almost floral, but with an undertone of labor and tradition that suggests she's no stranger to effort behind beauty. She's often found in kitchens or tucked away in overlooked corners, imbuing everything around her with color and quiet intensity. Those who know her say she’s rare, even precious—though some might walk right past without noticing, unaware of how much she brings to the table.
